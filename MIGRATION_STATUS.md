## MIGRATION APPROACH

Each template should include:
1. `{% extends 'base.html' %}`
2. `{% load static %}`
3. `{% block extra_css %}` for page-specific styling
4. `{% block content %}` for main content
5. Django template tags for dynamic data
6. JavaScript in inline `<script>` tags or separate files

## NEXT STEPS

2. Cart page - Core functionality
3. Menu page - Core functionality
